        I'm the cofounder and CEO of Misogi Labs. We work with pharma and CROs to integrate AI
        agents in preclinical R&D and IP workflows. We believe that by freeing scientists from
        everything that isn't science and doesn't require human genius, we can significantly
        augment the pace of discoveries. For more, check our website or reach out at jessica (at)

        I went to university at Politecnico di Milano, where I earned my MSc in Bioengineering, and
        to University of Padova, where I earned my BSc in Biomedical Engineering. I graduated magna
        cum laude with highest honors and was awarded several prestigious prizes for scholarly
        achievements (ranked top 2 among all 7k master's students). During my studies I also had
        the opportunity and honor to be a Teaching Assistant in Analysis & PDE, Physics, and
        Biomechanics. I loved teaching and till my early 20s I thought I would continue my career
        in academia.

        In my last year of BSc I started doing academic research in the lab. I worked on
        engineering CSP peptides to inhibit communication of bacterial quorum sensing and biofilm
        formation, under the supervision of Prof. Monica Dettin and Paola Brun. Here is the link to
        the thesis (in Italian).

        In my first year of MSc, I was introduced to physics-based biological simulations, first
        with fundamental CFD and physics of biomass with Professor Gabriele Dubini, then
        applications in biomedical devices (Gaetano and Costantino), tissues and regenerative
        medicine (Fiore and Rasponi), cell mechanics (Monica Soncini), and nanomedicine (Cellesi
        and Gautieri). Under the supervision of Professor Gautieri I started working on protein
        engineering and molecular dynamics simulations research. In the meantime I developed my
        passion for AI. I started learning about Deep Learning after neuroengineering classes with
        Pedrocchi and Cerveri.

        During my last year of MSc, I moved to Japan where I conducted research under the
        supervision of Prof. Noriyoshi Arai, Kenji Yasuoka, and Alfonso Gautieri. I worked on the
        application of deep learning to microsecond-scale molecular dynamics simulations. For my
        thesis I built an ML framework to analyze MD simulations at scale and rank potential drug
        candidates by predicting strength of dynamic interaction. This felt like a startup project
        for the pace and breadth of work. I published the work in RSC Advances, presented at the
        ISMC2023 Osaka, and defended my thesis dissertation.

        I love motorcycles, the ocean, music, and sports. I'm currently obsessed with tennis. I
        always had a soccer ball at my feet, but committed to volleyball and played on a regional
        team. I also love traveling and immersing myself in new cultures. I have Italian-Albanian
        origins. I've lived on 3 continents, made friends in 18 countries, and have friends from 53
        countries. One day, I'll travel around the world for a year.
