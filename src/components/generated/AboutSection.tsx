        I'm the cofounder and CEO of <a href="https://www.misogilabs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="underline hover:text-gray-500 transition-colors">Misogi Labs</a>. We work with pharma and CROs to integrate AI
        agents in preclinical R&D and IP workflows. By freeing scientists and IP professionals from
        repetitive tasks and automating complex workflows with biochemistry-aware AI, we give them their time back 
        to focus on driving transformative discoveries. For more, check out our website or reach out at jessica (at)

      <p>I went to university at Politecnico di Milano, where I earned my MSc in Bioengineering, 
        and to University of Padova, where I earned my BSc in Biomedical Engineering. I graduated 
        magna cum laude with highest honors and received several awards for academic achievements. 
        During my studies I also had the opportunity and honor to be a Teaching Assistant in Analysis 
        & PDE, Physics, and Biomechanics. I loved teaching and till my early 20s I thought I would 
        continue my career in academia.</p>

        In my last year of BSc I started doing academic research in the lab. I worked on
        engineering CSP peptides to inhibit communication of bacterial quorum sensing and biofilm
        formation, under the supervision of Prof. Monica Dettin and Paola Brun.

        In my first year of MSc, I was introduced to physics-based biological simulations, first
        with fundamental CFD and physics of biomatter with Prof.Dubini, then
        applications in biomedical devices (Prof. De Gaetano and Costantino), tissues and regenerative
        medicine (Prof. Fiore and Rasponi), cell mechanics (Prof. Soncini), and nanomedicine (Prof. Cellesi
        and Gautieri). Under the supervision of Prof. Gautieri I started working on protein
        engineering and molecular dynamics simulations research. In the meantime my
        passion for AI also grew. I started learning about Deep Learning after neuroengineering classes with
        Prof. Pedrocchi and Cerveri.

        During my last year of MSc, I moved to Japan where I conducted research under the
        supervision of Prof. Noriyoshi Arai, Kenji Yasuoka, and Alfonso Gautieri. I worked on the
        application of deep learning to microsecond-scale molecular dynamics simulations. For my
        thesis I built an ML framework to analyze MD simulations at scale and rank potential drug
        candidates by predicting strength of dynamic interaction. This felt like a startup project
        for the pace and breadth of work. I published the work in RSC Advances, presented at the
        ISMC2023 Osaka, and defended my thesis dissertation.

        I love motorcycles, the ocean, music, and sports. I'm currently obsessed with tennis. I
        always had a soccer ball at my feet, but committed to volleyball and played on a regional
        team. I also love traveling and immersing myself in new cultures. I have Italian-Albanian
        origins. I've lived on 3 continents, made friends in 18 countries, and have friends from 53
        countries. One day, I'll travel around the world for a year.
